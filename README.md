I recently created my own personal resume webpage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was part of my self-learning journey to enhance my frontend development skills.

Instead of sharing a static PDF, I wanted to build something more dynamic and creative â€” a personal webpage that presents my:

Education

Skills

Projects

Contact information

It was a great learning experience where I worked on:

Clean layout and design

Mobile responsiveness

Section-wise navigation
